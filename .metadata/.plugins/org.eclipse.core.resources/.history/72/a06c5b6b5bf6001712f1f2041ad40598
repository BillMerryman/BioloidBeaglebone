/** @file visionManager.h
 *  @brief Function prototypes for managing images/vision.
 *
 *  These are the prototypes for functions that: setup the pointers to where the PRU will
 *  write image data and an image data ready flag, process and display the image data
 *  from the shared memory in OpenCV windows, and garbage collect the image data when the
 *  program shuts down. The image ready flag is a cheap way to deal with the fact
 *  that the PRU can write data to the shared memory much faster than the application
 *  processor can consume it. We will want to come up with a better way of working with images
 *  on the application processor side. Image processing is currently just using OpenCV
 *  cvInRangeS function to mask a certain color (aibo ball pink) and cvMoments to identify
 *  instances of it in the image. The initialize function creates two windows, one for the
 *  image and one for the thresholded mask. The main loop updates these windows when the image
 *  ready flag is set.
 *

 *  @bug No known bugs.
