 *
 *  These are the prototypes for functions that: setup the pointers used to
 *  communicate with the memory shared between the application processor and PRU,
 *  place requests in the shared memory to the PRU motion worker, and to load a
 *  motion file from the file system into the shared memory so the PRU motion worker
 *  can retrieve and use them.
