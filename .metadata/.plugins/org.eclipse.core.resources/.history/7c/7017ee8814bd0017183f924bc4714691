 * We originally had to define the location in the PRU where the PRU would
 * store a pointer to the PRU driver allocated memory in the main system memory area
 * so we could store the address of that memory there so the PRU could access it. We
 * did so like this:
 *
 * 		#define VIDEO_POINTER_OFFSET 				 0x00000140  //(offset from beginning of PRU memory, derived from MAP file of PRU program
 *
 * We now have the makefile run a script that parses this out of the MAP file produced
 * by the compiler when building the PRU program, so hard coding is no longer necessary.
